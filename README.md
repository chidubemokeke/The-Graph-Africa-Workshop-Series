# The Graph Africa Workshop Series | Entities and Relationships

## Description

**The GraphQL Schema**

The schema for your subgraph is in the `schema.graphql` file. GraphQL schemas are defined using the GraphQL interface definition language.dd

**ENTITIES**

It is good practice to understand how your data is structured and linked. Always take time to look through **dataSources.mapping.eventHandlers** section in your `subgraph.yaml` file as this would give you a mental model on the various events' fields which you would leverage upon when defining the **entities** types within your `schema.graphql` file.

**_NOTE:_**

"_Entities should be seen as objects containing data rather than as events or functions_" - [The Graph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#defining-entities)

## Let's Build ðŸš€

The contract we would be working with is the CryptoPunk NFT smart contract.

### A bit about CryptoPunks

"_The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain_". - [CryptoPunks Official Website](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)

**ETHEREUM CONTRACT ADDRESS**

`0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB`

### subgraph.yaml

A look at the **subgraph.yaml** file, within the `dataSources.mapping` section, we see the **entities** (objects containing data) we'd be developing.

The **eventHandlers** is simply an array of events (defined in the smart contract) and their respective [function handlers](./src/cryptopunks.ts)

### schema.graphql

**_Note :_** the entities stated in the `dataSources.mapping.entities` section in the `subgraph.yaml` file have their type definition in this file - `schema.graphql`

#### A bit on ENTITY RELATIONSHIP

An entity may have a relationship to one or more entities in your schema.

In our example, the DigitalArt entity has a **ONE-TO-ONE** relationship with the `Collector` entity using the `owner` field as shown below:

```graphql
type DigitalArt @entity {
  # Unique identifier for a piece of digital art, typically the token ID.
  id: ID!
  # Punk Index
  tokenId: BigInt!
  # The current owner of the digital art piece.
  owner: Collector!
  # The history of transfers for this piece of digital art.
  history: [ArtTransfer!]! @derivedFrom(field: "art") # The history of transfers for this piece of digital art.
}
```

The relationship can be unidirectional as shown above or bidirectional.

Take a moment to check if the code-block above has any other field that exhibits a relationship with some other entity?

**...**

YES! The `history` field has a **ONE-TO-MANY** relationship with `ArtTransfer` entity.

A **ONE-TO-MANY** relationship is a field pointing to an array of an entity.

"_An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. These elements are usually of the same type_"

#### CHECKPOINT âœ‹

A **ONE-TO-ONE** Relationship: `owner: Collector!`

A **ONE-TO-MANY** Relationship: `history: [ArtTransfer!]! @derivedFrom(field: "art")`

### Handler functions ./src/cryptopunks.ts

Diving into the `cryptopunks.ts` file in the `src` directory, we can populate our entities within the handleX function blocks.

At the top, we import the auto-generated event types that the Graph `graph codegen` command provides us with. We also have some generic types imports from "**@graphprotocol/graph-ts\***" module like - _BigInt_ (for `uint256`), _Bytes_ (for `address`)

#### Populating fields in an Entity - `Collector`

For the `Collector` entity, the fields include:

- `id`
- `walletAddress`
- and `collection`

Within the `handleAssign` function, we accept an event param (typed to **Assign**) which holds the event data (indexed fields, transaction details), we can use this data to populate our `Collector` entity. We perform a check to see if an `id` exists by passing the `to` Assign event field into the `Collector.load` function.

If this collector with this address as `id` field exists, we skip else, we instantiate the `Collector` entity by passing the id as `new Collector(event.params.to.toHexString())`. This returns a new `Collector` entity class which we can set the `walletAddress` using the `event.params.to` address value and saving the new collector to be indexed by the Graph.

<details>

<summary>Code</summary>

```js
export function handleAssign(event: Assign): void {
  // Convert the 'to' address from the event to a hex string to use as the collector's ID.
  let collectorId = event.params.to.toHexString();

  // Attempt to load an existing collector from the subgraph by ID. If none exists, `null` is returned.
  let collector = Collector.load(collectorId);

  // If the collector does not already exist, create a new one with the given ID.
  if (!collector) {
    collector = new Collector(collectorId); // Instantiate a new Collector entity with the collectorId.
    collector.walletAddress = event.params.to; // Set the wallet address of the collector to the 'to' parameter from the event.
    collector.save(); // Save the new collector entity to the subgraph.
  }
  ...
}
```

</details>

Feel free to PERUSE through the codebase and notice how we populate our various entities using various events that contain the data we need.

## TASK

This is where you flex those big muscles of yours and show off what you've learnt ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª in this workshop!

1. Notice how there are no entities that track the amount of `ETH` used to purchase a **DigitalArt**. Create an entity in the `schema.graphql`, define the entity and handler in your `subgraph.yaml` file and develop the appropriate code to populate your own defined entity within the event handler in the `./src/cryptopunks.ts` file.

2. Develop a different subgraph and create custom entities that use the event data creatively to make your subgraph efficiently serve rich blockchain data ðŸ˜Ž

3. Prepare a README for this repository...

#### HAPPY Hacking ðŸš€ðŸš€
